# GA Tech SURE Program Summer 2021

I am storing my final deliverables from the SURE program here. 

This summer I worked in Dr. Wei Sun's Tissue Mechanics Lab, contributing to a project to use deep learning to automate the segmentation of the whole human heart. This is currently an unsolved problem in the field of biomedical engineering, due to the complexity and complex topology of the human heart. My role in contributing to the project was assisting with the labelling of the train-test dataset which will then be used to train the neural net to segment the whole heart.
